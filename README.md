### DESCRIPTION OF MY PROJECT
A 3D Tower Defense Game in Unity and C#

### DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME 
In this game, the players must build and upgrade towers to defend a battle field and not let enemies pass.
There are 3 types of towers:
  * Stone Tower: Throws stones at enemies.
  * Fire Tower: Attacks with fire area at enemies.
  * Ice Tower: Throws an ice attack at enemies and freezes them.

To build and upgrade towers the players must spend gold that can be obtained from the death of different enemies.

There are 3 types of enemies:
  * Tank Enemy: Slow enemy with a lot of health points.
  * Normal Enemy: Regular speed and health points.
  * Speed Enemy: Very fast enemy with a little more health points than a normal enemy.

If an enemy is special it gives more gold. The enemies that give more gold are the Tank enemies, then the Speed enemies, and finally, the Normal enemies.
Players can manage their towers as they want and can also sell them to obtain their money back, but they only will receive half of what they spent.
